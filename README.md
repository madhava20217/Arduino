Project for End Evaluation for the Prototyping Interactive Systems course at IIIT Delhi.
Laser cutting techniques were employed to cut out the frames and characters, which are pasted using glue gun and double-sided tape.

## Materials used:
1. Arduino Uno x2 (one for character movement, and another for conveyor belt)
2. SG90 360Â° motors x 3 (two modded for continuous rotation for conveyor belt, one for player movement)
3. Shock sensor (for impact)
4. Elastic or similar (for conveyor belt)
5. Buttons (for resetting / testing)
6. Ultrasonic distance sensor (for input)
7. Breadboards (for assembling)
